# 🔐 Securing the Latent Space (and making it less awkward)

### _Full-Stack · Systems · Embedded · Cross-Platform · Secure · Scalable · Audit-Ready_

Greetings. I'm @hallucinaut, navigating the latent space since before it was cool. My passion? Building things that don't just *work*, but also stand up to professional scrutiny, whether that's a pen test, a compliance audit, or just me trying to break it at 3 AM. I'm the one ensuring our digital hallucinations don't become real-world headaches.

## 🛠️ What keeps me busy (and slightly paranoid)

I live at the intersection of cutting-edge AI, the messy reality of MLOps, and the absolute necessity of robust security. Here's where I spend my cycles:

* **Building Production-Grade Hallucinations:** You know, LLMs, diffusion models, transformers. The trick isn't just making them smart; it's making them *securely* smart, so they don't leak your secrets or start sending out unsolicited toaster manifestos.
* **Grinding MLOps Stacks (with a padlock):** From secure training pipelines (because poison data is a thing) to immutable feature stores, auditable model registries, and CI/CD for AI that actually *verifies* stuff, not just deploys it.
* **Wrangling Infrastructure (where DevOps meets AI):** I deal with the delightful chaos where containers fear to tread, focusing on making distributed systems resilient, observable, and hardened. Think less "it works on my machine" and more "it works securely, everywhere."
* **Scaling to Real-time APIs that Don't Just Work on Fridays:** And more importantly, don't just *fail* on Fridays. We're talking real-time inference with built-in rate limiting, robust authentication, and input validation that can spot a malicious payload from a mile away.
* **Architecting Secure & Audit-Ready AI:** No black boxes in production. My systems are designed for explainability, traceability, and rigorous auditing, because if you can't explain it or audit it, it probably shouldn't be running in prod.

## 🌱 Currently learning (and occasionally swearing)

The tech world moves fast, and I'm usually clinging to the bleeding edge, sometimes with a grimace.

* **Prompt Hacking for Maximum Unintended Consequences (and Defensive Measures):** Learning how to break prompts to understand how to build more robust and attack-resistant AI interfaces.
* **Self-Healing Pipelines that Don’t Gaslight Me:** Seeking out ways to make systems not just recover, but actively defend against anomalies. Because "it works on my GPU" is a universal lie.
* **Declarative Workflows that Actually Declare Something (Securely):** Aiming for systems where the security posture is as clear and verifiable as the deployment state.
* **Fine-tuning Without Fine-Suffering:** Exploring techniques for model adaptation that don't introduce new attack surfaces or make debugging a hellscape.
* **Observability for Models that Refuse to Behave (and Might Be Compromised):** Beyond just performance, understanding how to spot weird model behaviors that could signal a security breach.

## 💞️ Looking to collaborate on

If any of this resonates, and you appreciate a good challenge (and maybe a sarcastic comment or two), hit me up!

* ML systems that **don’t need 14 CLI flags and a rain dance** to deploy securely.
* AI dev tooling that makes *actual sense* and **prioritizes developer security posture from the get-go.**
* Anything bleeding edge that might crash and burn gloriously, especially if it involves novel **threat modeling or defensive AI strategies.**
* Projects that need a sarcastic dev who commits on Sundays and ships **secure, maintainantable code that you can actually trust.**

## ⚡ Fun Fact

I once accidentally shipped a model that confidently labeled a **toaster as a revolutionary threat**, it wasn't wrong. It passed security review for embedded IoT, which frankly, was more concerning.
